# Data Science Projects

**[Heart Disease Detection](../blob/master/2204%20Final%20Project.ipynb)**

This project used both Logistic Regression and Tree-based algorithms and Voting classifiers to predict the occurance of heart disease. Using Feature Selection and hyperparameter tuning, the Logistic Regression model performed at **82 +/- 5% recall** with an AUC of 0.85.
 
 **[Cancer Detection](../blob/master/Capstone.ipynb)**

Using cancer pre-screening data from Princess Margaret Hosptial, the task was to predict the occurance of Stage I cancer. This project used raw data that required preprocessing, and 3 models were created: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. Optimized LogReg and SVM models performed at **97% and 99% recall**, respectively. A report and presentation were created, geared towards non-technical stakeholders.
